# Step 1: Import the necessary libraries
import Bio
from Bio import SeqIO
from Bio import Phylo

# Step 2: Input Data
# Let's say a text file with sequences in a supported format (e.g., FASTA)
input_file = "input_sequences.fasta"

# Step 3: Read and Process Sequences
sequences = []
for record in SeqIO.parse(input_file, "fasta"):
    sequences.append(record)

# Step 4: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
# We use a tool like ClustalW, MUSCLE, or MAFFT for MSA
aligned_sequences = perform_msa(sequences)

# Step 5: Distance Matrix Calculation
# Calculate genetic distances between sequences
distance_matrix = calculate_distance_matrix(aligned_sequences)

# Step 6: Tree Construction
# Build a phylogenetic tree using a method like UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining
phylogenetic_tree = construct_tree(distance_matrix)

# Step 7: Visualize or Save the Tree
# We save the tree in a file or visualize it using Biopython
